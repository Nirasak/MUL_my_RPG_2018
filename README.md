• The player can fight enemies, statistics will impact the fights results.  
• There must be NPC in your game.  
• You need to implement at least one quest.  
• The player must have an inventory which can contain a limited set of items.  
• The player can earn experience by winning fights and accomplishing specific actions.  
• With enough experience, the player can level up, upgrading its statistics.

• Create a coherent universe (visual assets, audio assets, scenario, . . .)  
• Create a funny game where the player has at least one goal.  
• Create a game with a beginning and an end.
